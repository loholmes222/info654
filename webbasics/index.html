            <h2>Historical Summary</h2>

            <p> Lesbian pulp fiction was most popular in the United States during the mid-20th century as part of the paperback boom after WWII.
                The paperback boom following WWII in the United States gave rise to pulp fiction. Considered “low-brow,” inexpensive, 
                these condensed novels were sold in widely accessible locations, such as supermarkets, drugstores, and airports. 
                Paperback genres included mysteries, westerns, crime/noir, and especially surprisingly lesbian pulp fiction. 
                Inexpensively priced and cheaply constructed out of wood pulp paper, pulp fiction was destined to become brittle and crumble to the touch. 
                Lesbian pulp fiction was not seen as valuable literature in academia until decades after its fall in popularity. 
                These novels, usually written under pseudonyms, often discussed and depicted lesbian sexual situations to titillate its male audience. 
                While subgenres within pulp fiction had their own politics—especially during its golden age of the 1950s and 1960s—lesbian 
                pulp fiction contains various elements that have been used and referenced for decades afterwards. 
                For example, some methods of circumventing American obscenity laws, lesbian pulp fiction forcibly condemned queerness, which impacted narrative structures, 
                such as tragic endings; inaccurate and/or fetishizing front and back covers; insistence of the unhappiness of queer life; and association with criminality, 
                such as murder and drug abuse. Fetishizing lesbian relationships and commodifying women's bodies, especially as images and objects, were at the center of their production. 
                However, this fetishization and objectification was not always the reason for their consumption. 
                Queer women's readership indicates the value placed on this seemingly overlooked genre.</p>

            <p> Lesbian pulp fiction operated under strange circumstances during
                its height during the mid-20th century, profiting off of the 
                fetishization of female couplings while presenting the 
                opportunity for lesbian representation for mass consumption
                for the first time. This subgenre of pulp popularized damaging tropes of lesbians and their experiences, contributing to stereotypes that follow lesbians almost seventy  
                years later. Despite the fetishizing and capitalizing of lesbian intimacy, both queer authors and readers (including those sympathetic folks who were not queer) 
                destabilized and complicated the genre from within, publishing pulps that allowed more grace, maturity, and camp into this once popular form of representation. 
                Authors, marginalized in their own terms, resisted midcentury values within these novels, even as they were legally required to reinforce these values, such as conformity, 
                whiteness, heterosexuality, and the nuclear family. Instead, these authors brought slight reprieves to this otherwise oppressive time, depicting found families, community, 
                everyday struggles of queerness and gender nonconformity, and (non)normative bodies and desire. </p>
            
            <p>While existing in this contradictory space, lesbian pulps also reinforced midcentury values through expressin the unspeakability of queerness, wordlessness, 
                and sexual violence. Lesbian pulp fiction exposes the vulnerability and instability of midcentury values through the depiction of (non)normative sex, desire, and 
                community. While the so-called accuracy of these stories is doubtful, lesbian pulp fiction provided an outlet for authors and readers to express their own 
                versions of queerness through a variety of plots, characters, and endings. The true creativity, however, is the balance many of these queer authors of lesbian 
                pulp fiction represented a marginalized group with care and depth. After the gender-bending events of WWII, in which white, middle-class women 
                entered the work force for the first time, popular culture and media for mass consumption, such as lesbian pulp fiction, attempts to reign women 
                in back to the household and nuclear family. And while the cover illustrations, blurbs, and author's notes condemn this gender-bending and transgressing, 
                what lies between the pages extends opportunity to continue to transgress; that is, for white women not before part of the workforce. </p>

            <ul>
                <li><i>The Price of Salt</i> or <i>Carol</i> by Patricia Highsmith, published under Claire Morgan (1952)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>While arguably the most well known lesbian pulp, Highsmith is not known (nor would have wanted to be known) as a pulp author. 
                    She struggled with accepting her sexuality, the book based on a daydream while working at Macy's during the holiday season to 
                    pay for her own conversion therapy.</li>
            </ul>
                <li><i>Spring Fire</i> by Marijane Meaker, published under Vin Packer (1952)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Marijane Meaker and Patricia Highsmith had a several years long relationship in the 1950s and 1960s, narrativized in Meaker's memoir 
                    <i>Highsmith: A Romance of the 1950s</i> (2003).</li>
            </ul>
                <li><i>Women's Barracks</i> by Tereska Torres (1950)</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Women's Barracks</i> is a semi-memoir of Torres' time in London during WWII, the first lesbian pulp to cross the Atlantic. 
                    Despite not identifying as queer, she portrayed the complexities of queer desire during wartime. Translated by her husband. 
                    Meyer Levin, much of the 
                    moralizing that exists in the text is his addition to pacify American obscenity laws. </li>
