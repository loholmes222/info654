        While there are 20 known queer women that wrote lesbian pulp fictions, tracking their pseudonyms and titles have proved difficult, especially since 
        various men that wrote pulps used feminine names to increases sales. The idea of authorship with lesbian pulp fiction is complicated as a result. 
        In addition, the concept of queerness has evolved over the last seventy years to where various authors of lesbian pulp that would have called themselves 
        different from heterosexual people, identities change over time. It is very likely that some authors would not call themselves queer or lesbian then or now, had they 
        the language to describe their affect. It is unwise to ascribe an identity to someone that might not connect with those words or phrases, 
        leading to a fascinating study of the rapidly changing queer community and its understanding of itself over the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

        <p>Covers of lesbian pulp fiction are always of conventionally attractive white women. The so-called "butch," 
        or the masculine woman will have short hair and wear pants, but not always. The marketing of lesbian pulp fiction reinforces midcentury values of 
        whiteness, femininity, gender roles, etc.</p>

        <p>Lesbians are profitable both as content and authors of content; men fetishized queer women, while queer individuals found a contorted, 
            fun-house mirror reflection of certain queer experiences. The covers of lesbian pulps actively play a role in the lesbian pulp business, 
            portraying glimpses into the underworld of lesbianism, an unaccepted lifestyle, but nevertheless intriguing, salacious, and entertaining. 
            This transgression of notions of public and private—accepted and unaccepted—are part of their allure. Lesbian pulp fiction aided in defining American lesbian culture, 
            both to the heteronormative world and in queer communities. While it depends on the authors of such novels, there are real glimpses of queer life 
            and feelings within the pages of lesbian pulp. 
            As a result, the lesbian pulp discussed within this work is either written by queer people or by those that attempted to portray positive representations of queer people.
