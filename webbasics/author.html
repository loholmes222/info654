            <h1>The Golden Era of Lesbian Pulp Fiction:</h1>
            <h3>About the Author: Lauren Holmes</h3>
        </div>
        
        <p>Lauren Holmes is lesbian pulp fiction scholar and aspiring queer archivist from San Diego, CA. She holds a Master's of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies
        from New York University Experimental Humanities & Social Engagement program. After studying queer history and lesbian literature at 
        NYU, she is currently a Library and Information Science graduate student at Pratt Institute, fascinated by queer affect and archiving, while working 
        at the New York Public Library as a Collections Processing Associate.</p>

        <p>Her research in this topic began while working as a graduate student at NYU Special Collections and taking "Writing Gender Histories"  
        with Dr. Michele Mitchell. Her thesis, titled: "(Non)Normative Bodies and Affect: the Value of Lesbian Pulp Fiction" explores affect and embodiment of
        lesbian pulp fiction characters, primarily masculine female characters (or butches). This page acts as a preliminary and introductory understanding of what lesbian 
        pulp fiction is and the more common discussions and questions in this niche, semi-dying field. </p>
